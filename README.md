# Pokemon-Spring
A project using Spring Webflux and R2DBC. It's part of my studies of Spring Framework.


## ðŸ’­ Why did I create this project?

This project, as I already said, is part of my studies. I like to always getting in touch with new technologies and work with Webflux is a brand new experience for me.
It has been fun to learn reactive programming and I'm enjoying a lot.


## ðŸ¤” What am I using on this project?


* Spring 2.4.0
* PostgreSQL 12.3
* Mockito 1.6.0

 
Currently, I'm creating the database and relations by myself. The webflux still doesn't have support for JPA but when it comes out, I will update the code for sure!
